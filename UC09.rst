Use Case #9 Relationships between Aerosol and Cloud ECV
=======================================================

:User Characteristics: User Level 1 High-level expert user (User Community 2 earth system science community)

:Problem Definition: A climate scientist wishes to analyse potential correlations between Aerosol and Cloud ECVs. 

:Exemplary Workflow: 
a)	The user selects CCI data products from a checklist. 
b)	The user selects the operation :doc:`Reprojection <geometric-adjustment/ob_spec_reprojection>` from the operation category :doc:`Geometric Adjustment <geometric-adjustment/ob_spec_category_geometric-adjustments>`.
c)	The user selects the particular options (reprojection method: cubic convolution, propagation of uncertainties analysis).
d)	The user clicks a button to execute.
e)	The Toolbox performs a reprojection of the datasets onto the chosen coordinate system. 
f)	The user selects a geospatial point of interest on a rotatable globe. 
g)	The user selects start and end years of a time range. 
h)	The user selects the operation :doc:`Time Series Plot <visualisation/ob_spec_time-series-plot>` from the operation category :doc:`Visualisation <visualisation/ob_spec_category_visualisation>`. 
i)	The user selects options (multiple datasets).
j)	The user clicks a button to execute.
k)	The Toolbox plots time series on the same axes. 
l)	The user selects the operation :doc:`Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (Pearson) <data-intercomparison/correlation-analysis/ob_spec_product-moment-correlation>` (operation category :doc:`Data Intercomparison <data-intercomparison/ob_spec_category_data-omtercomparison>`, operation subcategory :doc:`Correlation Analysis <data-intercomparison/correlation-analysis/ob_spec_subcategory_correlation-analysis>`).
m)	The user selects options (scatter-plot).
n)	The user clicks a button to execute.
o)	The Toolbox plots a scatter-plot and correlation statistics on the screen. 
p)	The user clicks on a “Save Image” option which saves the plot as a PNG file
q)	The user re-specifies the geospatial area of interest as a polygon on the rotatable globe.
r)	The user selects the operation :doc:`Animated Map <visualisation/ob_spec_animated-map>` from the operation category :doc:`Visualisation <visualisation/ob_spec_category_visualisation>`. 
s)	The user selects options (multiple datasets).
t)	The user clicks a button to execute.
u)	The Toolbox displays side-by-side animations.
v)	The user selects the operation :doc:`Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (Pearson) <data-intercomparison/correlation-analysis/ob_spec_product-moment-correlation>` (operation category :doc:`Data Intercomparison <data-intercomparison/ob_spec_category_data-omtercomparison>`, operation subcategory :doc:`Correlation Analysis <data-intercomparison/correlation-analysis/ob_spec_subcategory_correlation-analysis>`).
w)	The user selects options (map).
x)	The user clicks a button to execute.
y)	The Toolbox performs a pixel-by-pixel correlation between the two 2-dimensional time series, and generates a correlation map displayed on the screen. 
z)	The user clicks a button to save the output.
